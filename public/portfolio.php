	<h2>Part 2: The Code</h2>
	<hr>
	<p>Attempt to recreate your design with HTML and CSS. Plan out the HTML container you will need to make your design transition from mobile to desktop.</p>
	<h3>The Hints</h3>
	<h4>Mobile First</h4>
	<p>For the portfolio it is recommended to use the mobile first model. What this means is you will code and style your website in mobile format first. When you get to the point of CSS coding make your browser window as narrow as possible before adding any CSS. Once your website looks great a narrow size, make the screen wider. Once your CSS no longer looks good, add a media query for that screen size.</p>
	<p><span class="hint">Hint:</span> If you use the inspector tool while resizing the screen size, it will tell you the pixel width.</p>
