            <p>For the overarching project this semester you will be creating a website for a client. But who is this client, what do they do, and who do they serve? You are going to create this client yourself, but the client cannot be yourself.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <a href="#proposal"><h4>The Proposal</h4></a>
            <p>You know who your client is and you have a basic idea of what information and web pages they are going to need. Now it is time to propose what exactly you will be doing for the client.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <a href="#sitemap"><h4>The Site Map</h4></a>
            <p>The next step in the client project, a sitemap. In this week's discussion you came up with the information architecture, for the assignment you are going to take that information and lay it out in a nice format you can deliver to your client.</p>

            <a href="brand-guide"><h4>The Brand Guide</h4></a>
            <p>The brand guide will be a helpful tool as you move from wireframes to your website mockups. If you reference the guide as you build the mockups it will keep the design consistent from page to page.</p>

        <div>
            <a href="#wireframes"><h4>The Wireframes</h4></a>
            <p>You have now reached the final stage before fully designing your clients website, the wireframes. You will use the information architecture and sitemap as reference for your wireframes. Wireframes are low fidelity designs of the layout of your client's site.</p>

        <div>
            <a href="#mockups"><h4>The Mockups</h4></a>
            <p>Using the wireframes and brand guide you created, you will build a mockup design for each of the web pages in desktop and mobile sizes.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>The Code</h4>
            <p>Take all of the code you have learned and code the client's website as you have designed it.</p>

    <h2 id="wireframes">The Wireframes</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>You have now reached the stage before fully designing your clients website, the wireframes. You will use the information architecture and sitemap as reference for your wireframes. The wireframes will have a low level of fidelity. Focus on layout and high-level interactions (navigation and call to action buttons).</p>
    <p>
    <h3>The Requirements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>One desktop and mobile wireframe per website page. 10 total wireframes</li>
        <li>Gray-scale. Notice the only color in the examples is active links and is not a design color.</li>
        <li>Elements and content will be represented with boxes or lines, with label descriptions</li>
        <li>Utilize arrows and text to describe how interactive elements will function</li>
        <li>No pictures</li>
        <li>No content like paragraphs</li>

    <h3>The Requirements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>One desktop and mobile design per website page. 10 total designs</li>
        <li>Full Color</li>
        <li>Copy can be lorem ipsum. It is recommended for call to actions, tag lines, short text to use the actual content.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Recommendations</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Design interactive elements like buttons, mobile navigation, etc...</li>
        <li>Design the header for mobile and desktop before moving on to main content</li>
        <li>Remember order matters in html. It is really difficult to move an elements out of the order they are listed in html. For instance if you have one column for mobile and three columns for desktop, and you want to move the last element in mobile to the first in desktop it is difficult to accomplish.</li>
